eg-feature1 is a branch; git push origin feature1

git diff <-branch name-> (to compare commits, branches, files & more)
git merge <-branch name-> (to merge 2 branches) - you are in a branch; and want to merge another branch...write another branch name in <-branch name-> 

PULL REQUEST - it lets you tell others about changes you have pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub
maybe any senior dev reviews your changes; if any objection, will add comments and if all right confirm your pull request

PULL COMMAND - git pull origin main
used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update local rep to match that content
